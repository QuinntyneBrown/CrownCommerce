# Origin Hair Collective — Mission Statement

## Our Mission

Origin Hair Collective exists to bring premium, ethically sourced hair to the community through trusted partnerships and unwavering commitment to excellence. Founded in Toronto, we are dedicated to serving the people around us with integrity, quality, and purpose.

## What We Do

We import premium hair for wigs and extensions, delivering product that meets the highest standards in the industry. Our focus is on quality at every stage — from sourcing to delivery — so that the end result speaks for itself.

## How We Reach the Market

We are exploring and building across several channels to meet our customers where they are:

- **Direct to Consumers** — Providing individuals with direct access to premium hair products
- **Direct to Wig Makers** — Supplying the artisans and craftspeople who create custom wigs with the raw materials they need to do exceptional work
- **Direct to Hair Stylists** — Equipping salon professionals with premium hair for extensions and styling services
- **Online** — Making our products accessible through digital storefronts to reach a broader audience

## Who We Partner With

We partner exclusively with experts in the hair industry. We are selective because our reputation depends on it and because our partners deserve to work alongside people who understand the craft. Every partnership is built on mutual respect and a shared commitment to quality.

## Partner Success Is Non-Negotiable

Our partners meeting their goals and being successful is an absolute priority. We do not measure our success in isolation. When our partners thrive, we thrive. We invest in relationships, provide support, and hold ourselves accountable to ensuring the people we work with achieve what they set out to do.

## Our Foundation

Every decision — how we treat people, how we conduct business, how we grow — is guided by our values. Honesty, service, and doing right by others are not aspirations; they are requirements.

## Who We Are

We are **Black-owned** and **Toronto-based**. Serving our community is not a side initiative — it is central to why we exist. We understand the market because we are part of it, and we are committed to creating opportunity and access within the communities we call home.

## Our Growth

We are well funded and planning for aggressive growth. We have the resources and the vision to scale meaningfully, and we intend to do so without compromising on quality, values, or the strength of our partnerships.
