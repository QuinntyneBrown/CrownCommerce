# 1. WHY JUNE 13, 2026

The launch party date is strategically chosen based on the Origin Hair Collective business plan roadmap:

| Milestone | Timing |
|-----------|--------|
| Business plan finalized | February 2026 |
| Phase 1: Foundation (legal, suppliers) | Weeks 1-4 (~Feb-Mar 2026) |
| Phase 2: Brand Building (website, content) | Weeks 5-8 (~Mar-Apr 2026) |
| Phase 3: Inventory & Launch Prep | Weeks 9-12 (~Apr-May 2026) |
| **Phase 4: Soft Launch (website goes live)** | **Week 13 (~May 5-12, 2026)** |
| **Official Launch Party** | **Saturday, June 13, 2026** |
| Phase 4: Early Growth continues | Weeks 14-16 (~May-Jun 2026) |

### Why this date works:

- **~5 weeks after soft launch** — enough time to fulfill initial orders, collect first reviews/photos, and validate product-market fit before a public event
- **Real social proof available** — early customers can attend and share their experiences; have actual before/after content to showcase
- **Weather** — mid-June in Mississauga is warm and ideal for an outdoor or indoor/outdoor event
- **Before summer vacations** — catches the GTA audience before July/August travel season
- **Saturday evening** — maximizes attendance for working women (core demographic: 18-45)
- **Cultural timing** — aligns with wedding/event season when demand for premium hair peaks

# 2. EVENT VISION & GOALS

## Vision

A high-energy, culture-forward celebration that introduces Origin Hair Collective to the GTA market. The event should feel like an exclusive VIP experience — not a sales pitch. Think: music, cocktails, live hair demos, influencer meet-and-greet, photo moments, and a curated luxury unboxing experience.

## Goals

| Goal | Target | How to Measure |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Brand awareness | 50-100 attendees | Headcount + RSVP list |
| Social media reach | 50,000+ impressions from event content | Instagram/TikTok analytics |
| Email list growth | 50+ new sign-ups at event | Klaviyo list tracking |
| Launch-day sales | $1,500-$3,000 in on-site + online orders | Shopify + Square POS |
| Influencer partnerships | 3-5 new ambassador sign-ups | Follow-up conversations |
| Salon leads | 3-5 salon owners/stylists attend | Business card collection |
| Media/press | 1-2 local media mentions or blog features | Outreach tracking |
| Community building | Build initial loyal customer base | Post-event engagement |

# 3. VENUE OPTIONS

## Requirements

- Capacity: 50-100 guests
- Location: Mississauga or west Toronto (accessible to Peel Region + GTA)
- Aesthetic: Modern, clean, good lighting for photos/video
- Amenities: Electrical outlets, mirrors (for hair demos), parking, washrooms
- Availability: Saturday evening (5:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- Budget: $500-$2,500 for venue rental

## Venue Options (Mississauga / West GTA)

| Venue | Type | Capacity | Est. Cost | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|------|------|
| **Small Banquet Hall (Mississauga)** | Private event space | 50-120 | $800-$2,000 | Full control, catering options, parking | Higher cost |
| **Restaurant Private Dining Room** | Semi-private | 30-60 | $500-$1,500 (min spend) | Built-in catering/bar, atmosphere | Less customizable |
| **Salon/Barbershop After-Hours** | Partner salon | 30-50 | $0-$500 (barter/partnership) | Authentic setting, mirrors, chairs | Limited space |
| **Community Centre (Mississauga)** | Multi-purpose room | 50-150 | $200-$600 | Affordable, parking, accessible | Less glamorous (needs heavy decor) |
| **Art Gallery / Loft Space** | Creative venue | 40-80 | $1,000-$2,500 | Aesthetic, great for photos | May need outside catering |
| **Outdoor Pop-Up (park/patio)** | Open air | 50-100+ | $200-$500 (permits) | Weather-dependent buzz, free-flowing | Weather risk, limited power |

### Recommended

**Option 1 (Budget-Friendly):** Partner with a local salon for an after-hours event. Exchange promotion, product gifting, and a commission code for free or reduced venue cost. The salon setting is on-brand and provides built-in mirrors and styling stations for live demos.

**Option 2 (Strong Launch):** Rent a small banquet hall or loft space in Mississauga ($1,000-$1,500). Full creative control, better capacity, and a more "official" feel for press and influencer content.

The launch party replaces a portion of Month 2-3 marketing spend and serves as the single highest-impact marketing event of Year 1. At the recommended tier ($3,799-$6,617), it is a significant but justifiable investment that generates content, press, leads, and sales that compound over months.

| Metric | How to Measure |

| On-site revenue | Shopify POS + cash sales |
| Online revenue (ORIGINLAUNCH code) | Shopify discount code analytics |
| New email subscribers | Klaviyo list growth |
| Instagram follower growth (launch week) | Before/after count |
| TikTok follower growth (launch week) | Before/after count |
| Event content impressions (2 weeks) | Instagram + TikTok analytics |
| UGC posts created by guests | Hashtag tracking |
| Ambassador sign-ups | Application form submissions |
| Salon/wholesale leads | Business cards collected + follow-up responses |
| Media mentions | Google Alerts + manual tracking |

---

# 14. RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Low attendance | Medium | High | Over-invite by 30-40%; create FOMO with "limited spots" messaging; personal follow-up with RSVPs |
| Weather (if outdoor element) | Low-Medium | Medium | Have indoor backup plan; June weather in Mississauga is generally reliable |
| Vendor no-show | Low | High | Confirm all vendors 1 week + 1 day before; have backup DJ playlist; know a backup photographer |
| Product sells out | Low | Medium | Bring 20% more inventory than expected; take orders for anything out of stock |
| Tech failure (POS, WiFi) | Low-Medium | Medium | Have cash as backup; bring portable WiFi hotspot; test all equipment day before |
| Low on-site sales | Medium | Low | The event's primary value is brand awareness and content, not same-day revenue; post-event code captures delayed purchases |
| Negative social media | Very Low | Medium | Deliver a great experience; address any concerns immediately and professionally |
| Over budget | Medium | Medium | Track all expenses against budget weekly; identify "nice to have" vs. "must have" items early |

---

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **June 13, 2026 is the ideal date** — 5 weeks after soft launch, great weather, before summer vacations, Saturday evening for maximum attendance
2. **Budget $2,000-$5,000** for a strong launch event (recommended tier) — this is your single biggest marketing moment of Year 1
3. **Content is king** — the event will generate 3-4 weeks of social media content; invest in a photographer at minimum
4. **Start planning 8 weeks out** (mid-April) — venue booking and influencer outreach need lead time
5. **The launch party is a brand-building event, not primarily a sales event** — focus on community, experience, and relationships
6. **Follow up aggressively** — the real ROI comes from post-event conversions, ambassador partnerships, and salon wholesale leads

---

*This launch party plan is designed to complement the Origin Hair Collective business plan roadmap. All costs are estimates in CAD and should be confirmed with local vendors.*
